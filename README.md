<h1>About</h1>

This program offers a one-stop shop for all academic needs. Whether it is automated formatting of academic posters or helping you build a professional looking resume, Template Scholar has the resources for you.

<h2>Academic Posters</h2>
This generator prompts you to enter information you would like displayed on an academic poster. Typical sections include introduction, methods, results, figures, discussion, future direction, acknowledgements, etc. There is an area to upload external figures and graphs.
Once the user clicks the generate button the default format will be shown with options to customize.
<br></br>
In the future I would like to add a feature that allows the user to generate graphs, charts, and tables within this application.
<h2>Resume</h2>
This generator prompts you to enter information about yourself. Typical sections include personal information, education, work experience, awards, skills, etc. Once the user clicks the generate button the default format will be shown with options to customize.
<h2>CV</h2>
Similar to the resume maker, this generator prompts you to enter information about yourself. A CV, curriculum vitae, is a longer academic list that includes more experiences, certifications, publications, and coursework.
Once again the document rendered on the generate button and the default format will be shown with options to customize.
<h2>Assignment Tracker</h2>
The assignment tracker offers a digital planner application. This can help you keep track of homework, exam, and project dates easily with spreadsheet type data that can be stored, appended, and exported. It keeps track of due dates and can generate workplans based on this information.
<h2>Presentation</h2>
(honestly I'm not sure what this looks like yet)
<h2>Citation Generator</h2>
Given prompts to enter various information about a source, the generate button will produce a single citation and the option to create a new reference page or add to an existing one. Users can choose between various popular formats including APA, MLA, or Chicago.
<br></br>
In the future I would like to add a feature that will just accept the link to a website and will generate the citation for you automatically.
